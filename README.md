    // Normalizes street types to standard abbreviations.
    console.log(addresser.parseAddress("1301 Columbia College Drive Unit 101 Columbia, SC 29203"));

    { id: '1301-Columbia-College-Dr,-Unit-101,-Columbia,-SC-29203',

NOTE: Currently addresser supports only US & Canada addresses.  

## Functions

### parseAddress

parseAddress will accept an address string and convert it into structured address 
data. Addresser is designed to be flexible and forgiving in terms of the 
formatting of the address string but it does assume a general order of street 
data, city data and state data from left to right. parseAddress will normalize
state names and abbreviations and can recognize state data regardless of case or format.

parseAddress will try to validate that the city provided is valid for the given state.
This allows for more intelligent parsing logic when propert delimiters are not used. 
parseAddress also normalizes street types to standard abberviations ie. Drive to Dr, Street to St, etc.

parseAddress creates a unique id for all addresses based on the parsed
values. Currently there is no easy, universal ID available for property
addresses and this package should help bridge that gap for developers who 
need to cross reference property data across multiple data sources. An id is
generated only if all the address components are present including street address,
city, state and zipcode.

### getRandomCity

The getRandomCity function can be used to generate a random valid city. This can be helpful
when testing.

### cities

The cities function returns a JSON object that contains a list of all known cities and states. The structure is as follows:
    
    { 
      ...
      WI:
        [ 
          'Black River Falls',
          'Heafford Junction',
          'Washington Island',
          ...
        ],
      WY:
        [ 
          'Yellowstone National Park',
          'Saint Stephens',
          'Little America',
          ...
        ]
    }
